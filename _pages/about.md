I am a Deep Learning Researcher specializing in self-supervised learning and deep active learning, with applications ranging from archaeological monument detection in LiDAR data to synchrotron radiated micro-CT data analysis, and electron microscopy data. Originally from Ghazni, Afghanistan, I have a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Middle East Technical University, a Master's in AI from Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and a PhD from Leibniz University Hannover. Currently, I lead the data science lab for for electron microscopy -- a joint lab between IAS-9 and ER-C at the Institute for Materials Data Science and Informatics (IAS-9), Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich.
