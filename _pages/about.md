I am a Deep Learning Researcher with experience in various fields, including self-supervised learning for detection of archaeological monuments in LiDAR data and deep active learning applied to synchrotron radiated micro computed tomography data. I am originally from Ghazni, Afghanistan and have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey, a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain, and a PhD degree from Leibniz University Hannover, Germany.

I am now a part of the Data Analysis and Machine Learning group at the Institute for Materials Data Science and Informatics (IAS-9) at Forschungszentrum Jülich, where I lead the data science lab for deep learning and computer vision in electron microscopy.
