I am a Deep Learning Researcher with experience in various fields, including self-supervised learning for detection of archaeological monuments in LiDAR data and deep active learning applied to synchrotron radiated micro computed tomography data. I am originally from Ghazni, Afghanistan and have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. I then pursued a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at Polytechnic University of Catalonia in Barcelona, Spain. After completing my Master's, I came to Leibniz University Hannover, Germany, where I completed my PhD while working as a deep learning researcher at the Institute of Cartography and Geoinformatics.

I am now a part of the Data Analysis and Machine Learning group at the Institute for Materials Data Science and Informatics (IAS-9) at Forschungszentrum Jülich, where I continue my journey in deep learning research. I am always eager to learn and explore new challenges and am looking forward to making a positive impact in the field of deep learning.
