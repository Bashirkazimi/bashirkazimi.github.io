Our paper titled __Self-Supervised Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks for Electron Microscopy__  has been accepted at the [International Workshop on Computer Vision (CV4MS) 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/cv4ms-cvpr-2024/home) in conjunction with the [IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Conference](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024) in Seattle. I will give a talk presenting the paper on June 18, 2024 and also have a poster presentation.
