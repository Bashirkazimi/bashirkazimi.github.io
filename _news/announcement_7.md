I am excited to announce that I have recently joined the Data Analysis and Machine Learning group at the multidisciplinary Institute for Materials Data Science and Informatics at Forschungszentrum Jülich as a Deep Learning Researcher. This marks a new chapter in my journey as a deep learning researcher and I am looking forward to tackling new challenges and making a positive impact in the field.

Before this, I had the privilege of working at the Institute of Materials Physics at Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon for two years. It is a renowned research center in Germany, dedicated to the study of materials physics using advanced experimental and computational techniques. I was fortunate to work on cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to synchrotron radiated micro computed tomography data. The experiences and knowledge gained during my tenure there will undoubtedly be valuable in my new role.

The multidisciplinary Institute for Materials Data Science and Informatics (IAS-9) at Forschungszentrum Jülich is another renowned research center in Germany. The institute is dedicated to the development and application of advanced techniques for a wide range of scientific and industrial problems. The Data Analysis and Machine Learning group where I will be working, is committed to the development of machine learning and computational materials science methods. I am honored to be a part of this team and to continue my journey in deep learning research.

I am looking forward to working with the brilliant minds at the IAS-9 and to exploring potential collaborations with researchers from different fields. I am also excited to share my journey and learnings with my network through my personal website and other platforms. Thank you for your support and encouragement!
