I attended and presented a poster titled ___Enhancing Semantic Segmentation in High Resolution TEM Images: A Comparative Study of Batch Normalization and Instance Normalization__ at the [The Eighth Conference on Frontiers of Aberration Corrected Electron Microscopy (PICO24)](https://er-c.org/index.php/conferences/pico-2024/) that took place from April 21st to April 25th, 2024 at Kasteel Vaalsbroek located at the bordering point of the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.


My colleague [Karina Ruzaeva](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/ruzaeva_k) also had a poster contribution titled __Unsupervised Machine Learning -based STEM Diffraction Pattern Denoising for Enchanced Grain Visualisation in Phase-Change Materials__. 

There were great talks and poster presentations by brilliant scientists in the field of electron microscopy. We met and started collaborations with researchers from ER-C, IEK-9 and LMU.
