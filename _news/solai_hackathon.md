We are organizing a hackathon in Jena within the SOL-AI project that is funded through the Helmholtz Foundation Model Initiative. Members of the project from the four participating centers (FZJ, KIT, HZB and Hereon) will get together to work on training AI models for solar energy materials datasets.
