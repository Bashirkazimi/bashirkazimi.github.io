I had the wonderful opportunity to give a seminar on Artificial Intelligence to the talented students of Irshad Private School in Quetta, Pakistan. The session included high school students who amazed me with their curiosity, attentiveness, and thought-provoking questions.

From asking about AI applications and its ethical implications to discussing whether AI will replace humans or be used for harm, their questions reflected a depth of understanding and eagerness to learn that was truly inspiring. Their engagement and note-taking showed me how ready these young minds are to take on the challenges of tomorrow. I couldnâ€™t be prouder to interact with such bright and promising students.

This opportunity would not have been possible without the initiative and support of Ustad Esmatullah Yousafi who encouraged this session. I would also like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the leadership of Irshad Private School for facilitating and supporting this event. Their commitment to providing quality education and inspiring young learners is commendable.

I hope that through this webinar, I was able to spark curiosity, inspire ideas, and make a small but meaningful impact on these studentsâ€™ lives. Seeing their enthusiasm reminds me that the future is in good hands, and I look forward to seeing these young minds become the innovators, thinkers, and leaders of tomorrow.

Thank you to all the students, teachers, and leadership at Irshad Private School for this memorable experience.
