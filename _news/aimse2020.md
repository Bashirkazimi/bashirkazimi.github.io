I attendend and gave a talk on __Enhancing Semantic Segmentation in High-Resolution TEM Images through Pretraining on Unlabeled Data__ at the [1st Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Materials Science and Engineering 2023](https://dgm.de/aimse/2023/) that took place from 22 - 23 November, 2023 in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany.

[Prof. Stefan Sandfeld](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/sandfeld_s) had an invited talk titled __From the Roots of Data Science to Machine Learning of Materials' Microstructures and Properties__. 

My colleague [Karina Ruzaeva](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/ruzaeva_k) had a poster contribution titled __Unsupervised Machine Learning-Based STEM Diffraction Pattern Denoising for Enhanced Clustering and Grain Visualization in Phase Change Materials__ and won the best poster award :1st_place_medal:
