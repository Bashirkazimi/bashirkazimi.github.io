I attended the [Helmholtz AI Conference 2023](https://www.helmholtz.ai/themenmenue/latest/events/helmholtz-ai-conference-2023/index.html) at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg from June 12th to 14th, the conference delved into a diverse range of captivating topics. From the realm of general machine learning to the cutting-edge frontiers of machine learning on quantum computers, explainable AI, and sequential data, participants were treated to stimulating series of talks. 

Among great talks by other researchers, I especially enjoyed the keynote speeches by Prof. Zeynep Akata from University of TÃ¼bingen and Prof. Max Welling from University of Amsterdam. Prof. Akata gave a talk on "Explainability in Deep Learning Through Communication" and Prof. Welling gave a talk on applications of deep learning in sciences in a remarkable presentation titled "On Fluids and Representations".
