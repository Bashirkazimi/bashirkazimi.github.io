I was lucky to be part of the proposal for the project called SOLAI (A symbiotic modular foundation model for accelerating solar energy materials development). Together with KIT, HZB, and Hereon, coordinated by FZJ/IAS-9, we got funded through the Helmholtz Foundation Model Initiative (HFMI) call 2024.
