Proud to announce that we have successfully obtained funding through the Helmholtz Imaging Projects for our project in the field of imaging and data science, called "Deep-learning assisted fast in situ 4D electron microscope imaging" (FAST-EMI). Our institute director, Prof. Stefan Sandfeld and I, together with our collaborators, Prof. Christoph Kirchlechner and Dr. Subin Lee from Institute for Applied Materials â€“ Mechanics of Materials and Interfaces (IAM-MMI) aim to advance our comprehension of the degradation mechanisms affecting functional materials. This will be achieved by integrating advanced electron microscope imaging techniques with deep learning (DL).
